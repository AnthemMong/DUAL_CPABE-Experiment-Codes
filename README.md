# DUAL_CPABE-Experiment-Codes
### These experiment codes for my new paper on CP-ABE scheme. I implement them to compare the their efficiency. In addition, I also implement other functions including LSSS, symmetric encryption to suprrt the ABE implementation. But be careful if you intend to used them, there might be some error since I write them just for experiment.
#### 1. First, you should install the PBC and crypt lib.
#### 2. To run these schemes you should compile them as the tips said at the head of the files.
#### 3. Notice that these programs all run with parameters all said at files.
